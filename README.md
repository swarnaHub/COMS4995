This repository holds code for creating 10 cross validations from the dataset files and the three BILSTM models


To run this file
python script.py
There are some requisite folders which should be pre created before training .
Mostly data, tmp, concatdata and indomain_pred .
Inside concatdata we should create train, dev and test folders
